Guess the VORLDLE in 6 guesses. If you succesfully do that, your score increases by one and you get a new country
Each guess must be a valid country, territory, ...
After each guess, you will have the distance, the direction and the proximity from your guess to the target country.
Enter your guesses beside the flashing beside the ">". Good luck!

*Note: The bearing direction might seem off, however it's calculated "as the crow flies", meaning that it takes into account the curvature of the Earth. This is a challenge feature since it forces players to take into account the curvature of the earth when making their guess in order to make it more realistic and more difficult.

Pressing delete quits the program.
