# ics-project

An unrotated outline of a country is displayed on the screen. Your objective is to guess it. 
If you succesfully do that, your score increases by one and you get a new country.
Each guess must be a valid country or overseas territory (e.g. Greenland or Puerto Rico).
After each guess, you will have the distance, the direction and the proximity from your guess to the target country.
An arrow will also show pointing in the direction of the closest path from your guess to the target country.
The more green squares there are, the closer your guess was to the actual country.
Enter your guesses beside the flashing beside the ">". Good luck!

*Note: The bearing direction might seem off, however it's calculated "as the crow flies", meaning that it takes into account the curvature of the Earth. This is a challenge feature since it forces players to take into account the curvature of the earth when making their guess in order to make it more realistic and more difficult.

*Note 2: If you're stuck, you can look in the console to see the answer printed there. Try not to cheat too much!

*Note 3: The program only accepts countries with their correct capitalisations.

Pressing Delete quits the program.
